            <li>Created a program that simulated a GPS to find the shortest path between two locations using Dijkstra’s algorithm.</li>
            <li>Constructed code to generate a maze and a maze solver using DFS and a GUI.</li>
            <li>Utilized a custom-made Hash Table, Skip List, and AVL tree to create a program that corrected misspellings.</li>
            <li>Developed a “keyboard only” text editor.</li>
